The Presentation layer

The presentation layer is MVC Web application
With anonymous users, the application will use temporary users and cookies to persist the products in the shopping cart. When the users creates a profile, or login to the application, the information of the shopping cart will be asociate to the user.

With users with the role of content administrator, the application will provide other option to mantain the data and general configuration of the store.
